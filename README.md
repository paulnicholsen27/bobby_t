One of my best friends, Bobby T Boaz, worked at the Atlas Performing Arts Center and got very angry at anyone who ever called it the Atlas Theater.  So being the good friend that I am, I _only_ ever called it the Atlas Theater, with the sole intention of pissing me off.  We unexpectedly lost Bobby recently, so in his honor, here is a Chrome extension to change any web page's use of the phrase "Atlas Performing Arts Center" to "Atlas Theater", so I can continue annoying him forever.
